autosym - Automated Schematic Symbol Generation
===============================================

This project is created to generate schematic symbols by using a simple symbol
description format. Generalising schematic symbols into a plain text based
language has several advantages:
- version control
- portability
- simplicity

I'm using this script for quite a while and decided to share it. Autosym uses a
generic Python approach to generate schematic symbols from symbol description
files.

Well, its still work in progress but I'm getting close to rewrite my code to
make it usable for others. gschem is currently the only supported schematic
application. I'm planing to add eagle support next.

Script Usage
------------

The entry point allows you to generate symbols for gschem. The autosym-library
provides a set of example symbol descriptions.
```shell
python setup.py install
git clone https://github.com/markushutzler/autosym-library.git library
autosym library output
```
The gschem symbol files will be created in a new folder `output`. The same
output is generated by running `build-library.sh` in the example folder.

Module Usage
------------

If you want to use autosym in your own script you can use the following lines as
a basic template or look into autosym.py
```python
from autosym.description import Description
from autosym.render import gschem

symd = Description("test.symd")
symd.parse()
g = gschem.Symbol(symd)
data = g.generate(0)
h = open("symbol.sch", 'w')
h.write(data)
h.close()
```
Note that the module needs to be installed first.

Installation
-----------
```shell
python setup.py install
```
